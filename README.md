# Object-oriented programming challenge üìå
## What is it?
OPP is a programming pardigm which organizes the software in the concept of class and object. This organization makes the methods benefitial to collaborative development. Others benefits include reusability, scalability and efficiency.

## Important terms ‚ÄºÔ∏è
* **Classes**: Act as a blueprint for individual objects. It is where attributes and methods are held;
* **Objects**: Are instances of a class with defined data. Objects can represent to real-world objects or abstracts entities;
* **Attributes**: They are defined in the class and represent the state of the objects. They are the data that objects will store;
* **Methods**: A method is nothing more than the behavios of the objects. It is used for reusability or keeping fincionaluty encapsulated in a object at a time;

## Main keys üîë
1. **Abstraction**: It is the idea that objects will only store relevant fields for its purpose. We must hide unnecessary implementation code.
2. **Encapsulation**: This principle says that all important information must be private and cannot be accessed outside its defined class. Only the class has the authority to make changes.
3. **Inheritance**: Classes can reuse code from others classes. Developers are able to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.
4. **Polymorphism**: Objects are able to share behaviors and they can take on more than one. A child class is created, then it can extend the funcionalities of the parent class.
